Backend case study – Inventory Management System

This repository contains my solution for the Backend Engineering -home
case study for the Inventory Management System (StockFlow).

The case study is divided into three parts:
1. Code Review & Debugging
2. Database Design
3. API Implementation for Low-Stock Alerts

All design decisions, assumptions, and fixes are documented clearly.

## Repository Structure

- part1_code_review.md – Issues, impact, and corrected implementation
- part2_database_design.md – Database schema, gaps, and design decisions
- part3_low_stock_api.py – Backend API implementation
- assumptions.md – Assumptions made due to incomplete requirements
